    <h2>1. Qualifications for a Spareboard Operator</h2>
    <div class="dual-column">
      <div class="original">
        All Operators signing on the Spareboard List must be qualified to carry out all assignments of a Transit Operator.To be qualified to carry out all assignments of an Operator, the Operator must have met conditions or requirements and have completed the driver's training course for new Operators as set by CMBC. In the case of Operators transferring to another Transit Centre, they will have completed route training at the Transit Centre to which they have transferred.

    Operators cannot reject a Spareboard Assignment because of unfamiliarity, once they have received the training as set out in the above paragraph. Route maps, route descriptions, etc. are deemed sufficient instruction in the case of unfamiliarity.
  </div>
  <div class="simple">
    <strong>Plain English:</strong>
    You must be fully trained to drive any route, including route-specific training if you move to a new depot. Once you’ve been trained, you can’t refuse a shift by saying “I don’t know the route.”
  </div>
</div>

  </section>  <section id="section2">
    <h2>2. Safety Code</h2>
    <div class="dual-column">
      <div class="original">
        Operators must comply with:
        - No more than 13 hours of driving per day
        - No more than 14 hours on duty per day
        - No more than 16 hours total time in a day (Total Elapsed Time or TET)
        - At least 8 consecutive hours off before starting a new shift
        - 24 hours off in the past 14 days
        - Maximum 70 hours on duty in any 7-day period
        - No deferring off-duty timeA new cycle can begin after 36 consecutive hours off duty. Duty time includes driving, standby, lay-up, meetings, training, etc.

    You cannot sign or be assigned work that causes a violation of the Safety Code. If assigned incorrectly, you’ll be relieved and not paid minimums.
  </div>
  <div class="simple">
    <strong>Plain English:</strong>
    You can’t work too much in a week. You must get enough rest between shifts. If something goes over the legal limits, the company must fix it — and you might lose pay if you signed up for too much.
